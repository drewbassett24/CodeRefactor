## Homework for session 2: Horiseon Website Code Refactor
The Assignment was to refactor the Horiseon website in such a way as to meet accessibility standards, increase use of semantic elements in HTML code, as well as a logical structure, order elements sequentially and provide a concise, descriptive title. In addition, the Scout Rule was to be implemented.
## The Easy Bits
Some elements of the task were straightforward: **multiple classes** in the CSS code were duplicating effects and could be consolidated. Similarly, **multiple divs** in the HTML code could easily be assigned **semantic elements** instead. Comments were added.
## The Less Easy Bits
It took me longer to realise there was a **broken link** present in the HTML code, but it was fun to fix it once a spotted it! I was side-tracked by the code for the Heading, as I was *convinced* there was somethig unusual about the colour of the text in the 'seo' part of the title - the colour didn't appear significantly different on my screen.
## The Bits That Didn't Work
I also tried to replace elements in the CSS and in the HTML, as the **.benefit-lead, .benefit-brand and .benefit-cost classes** all seemed to do the same thing, but when I tried to do this, the side-bar lost its formatting and the icons grew huge, so I abandoned that and settled for consolidating into lists.
## Conclusions
I feel I made *huge* progress on this project and learned a huge amount. Some of the classmates were incredibly helpful, especially Dave. It was also useful having a **Tutorial** before I even started.
